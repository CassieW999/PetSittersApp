## Introduction

The aim of the App is for people to look for a pet sitter or volunteer to be a sitter. For example, a pet owner can create a post to look for a pet sitter when he/she is unavailable to take care of his/her dog. The user can create a post in the petsitting-in-need list and wait for someone to contact him/her, or the user could look for the suitable pet sitter on the pet sitter screen list.

## Target Users

- Someone who needs a pet sitter
- someone who want to be a pet sitter

## Screens

- **Home**: user could switch identity as a pet owner or pet sitter to see posts

- **Profile**: userâ€™s information such as username, location, etc.
- **Notification**: user will be notified when the pet sitter is interested in the post
- **Create Post**: user could create a post for looking for a pet sitter or being a pet sitter
- **Post Detail**: information of the post such as time duration, location, identity, type of pet, etc.
- **To-Do List**: user could add any scheduled event of the pet sitter as a reminder
